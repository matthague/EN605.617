The good:
Constant values that appear to be changeable for different configs.
Uses register and shared memory to do a multiply op.
Uses events to time kernel.
Has debug output that can be enabled / disabled.
Malloc / free is correct.
Compares outputs to make sure they are the same.

The bad:
Uses a var called num_threads = num_thrds... redundant.
Confusing blocksize/threadsize computations, and they happen inside the
call to launch the kernel. Do it somewhere else, and make it readable.
Doesn't do modulo, subtract, or add operations(maybe does add?).
Some atomicAdd function is called, but this only makes semi-sense in the
context of doing linear multiplication.
Function and variable naming is kind of confusing, it talks about doing
'linear' and 'matrix' multiplications, but these operations are not immediately
clear to the reviewer. Readability is poor.
