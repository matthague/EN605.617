The good:

On the upside, this code does attempt to add 192 things together. It also takes
care to time and output the time that it takes to do this operation on both GPU
and CPU. The code outputs some of the device information, which could be nice.
The variable names seem to be appropriate, but that's about where the good ends.

The bad:

N is not defined. Blocks and threads change, but the size of the arrays don't.
Memory is malloc'ed but not free'd. The code only implements the add operation.
The input arrays are not constructed to the spec given in the assignment page.
The (void**) in the cudamalloc is actually unnecessary (but this is just being
nitpicky). If they try to do a % b at any time, they'll get an error for trying
to reduce mod 0. Finally, the code doesn't output any thread or block information, it
just assumes that whoever ran it knows(not necessarily bad, but calling without
providing args might confuse someone).
