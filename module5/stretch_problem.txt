The major element of the assignment that we don't see in the stretch
code is anything to do with the constant memory. So we don't get to see
an example of cudaMemcpyToSymbol() anythinge else. It's possible that this
setup and use of constant memory would happen in the switch(module): statement,
but we only see case 5 and the default, and the code implies that case 6 would
utilize the constant memory. I would like to see this code give the user some
command line configuration options, but most of the parameters seem to be fixed.
Finally, I'm a fan of the outputCardInfo(), but I can see this being annoying--
the person running this code probably wants to understand the performance differences
that the memory types provide, and hopefully the code is written to be
agnostic to the actual hardware details.
