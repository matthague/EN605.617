libfreeimage3 and libfreeimage-dev are not installed.

a simple 'sudo apt-get install libfreeimage3 libfreeimage-dev'
would solve the problem, but I do not have the permissions to do this.

included is the output from running on my system, and a run.sh file that
will compile and run the tests if freeimage is actually installed on the system

included is also a CMakeLists.txt file that will use cmake to build the targets on
any updated system (cmake 3.21 or later)
